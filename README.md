I'm an experienced data engineer passionate about open source, automation, and maintainable code.

[Openverse](https://openverse.org) is a search engine for openly licensed media.
I've been a core committer to the project since 2021, working on all aspects of the
stack including the data pipeline, infrastructure, and community management.

**Repository**: [WordPress/openverse](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse)

## OpenOversight

[SPD.watch](https://spd.watch) is a Seattle-area fork of the [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com/) platform for tracking police misconduct in the United States. I initially created this fork in 2020 to track Seattle Police Department misconduct, and have since expanded it alongside other contributors to include other local law enforcement agencies.
